# Matching Game
Although still in progress development wise, you can play the game in its current state by going to the web address at the bottom of this page.

All you really have to do is push play, and start clicking cards. I will be adding more features (e.g., a way to restart a game without
having to refresh the page, a modal that will tell you your score, About/Contact pages, etc.).
There are a couple bugs that I have yet to solve (e.g., not allowing user to reclick on an already matched card), but I am actively working to fix them.

Any advice and added code will be highly appreciated (even if it isn't in the below languages/technologies/frameworks)!
