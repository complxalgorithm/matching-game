# Matching Game
Although still in progress development wise, this game can still be played by copying and pasting the code of each necessary file into your text editor and then opening the index.html file in your browser.
All you really have to do is push play, and start clicking cards. I will be adding more features (e.g., a way to restart a game without
having to refresh the page, a modal that will tell you your score, etc.).
There are a couple bugs that I have yet to solve (e.g., not allowing user to reclick on an already matched card), but I am actively working to fix this.
Any advise and added code will be highly appreciated!
